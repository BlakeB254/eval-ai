**Branch:** main (br-dark-bread-aejzote0)
**Database:** neondb
**Region:** aws-us-east-2

Your connection string has been added to `.env`:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_jBsFth8Dck0w@ep-empty-bush-ae60wjbm-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

## Database Schema

All tables have been successfully created:

1. âœ… **organizations** - Store organization details and custom application structures
2. âœ… **rubrics** - Define evaluation criteria and scoring systems
3. âœ… **applicants** - Manage applicant information
4. âœ… **applications** - Store submitted applications
5. âœ… **evaluations** - Record evaluation scores and feedback
6. âœ… **field_mappings** - Map fields between different organizations
7. âœ… **example_applications** - Store sample applications for testing

## Sample Data

A sample organization has been added:
- **Name:** Sample University
- **ID:** 1
- **Description:** A sample organization for testing the judging system
- **Application Fields:**
  - Full Name (text, required)
  - Email (email, required)
  - Personal Statement (textarea, required)

## Issues Fixed

1. âœ… **CORS Error** - Server now accepts requests from any origin in development
2. âœ… **Database Connection** - Connected to Neon PostgreSQL
3. âœ… **Schema Push** - All tables created successfully
4. âœ… **Sample Data** - Initial organization added

## Next Steps

Your app should now be fully functional!

### To Start the App:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will automatically:
- Find available ports (client and server)
- Connect to your Neon database
- Display the sample organization

### What You'll See:

- **Client:** http://localhost:5174 (or next available port)
- **Server:** http://localhost:3001/api (or next available port)
- **Organizations Page:** Should show "Sample University"

## Available Endpoints

- `GET /api/organizations` - List all organizations
- `GET /api/organizations/:id` - Get organization by ID
- `POST /api/organizations` - Create new organization
- `PUT /api/organizations/:id` - Update organization
- `DELETE /api/organizations/:id` - Delete organization
- `GET /api/rubrics?organizationId=1` - List rubrics for an organization
- `POST /api/rubrics` - Create new rubric
- `GET /api/applicants` - List all applicants
- `POST /api/applicants` - Create new applicant
- `GET /api/applications?organizationId=1` - List applications
- `POST /api/applications` - Submit application
- `GET /api/evaluations?applicationId=1` - List evaluations
- `POST /api/evaluations` - Create evaluation

## Database Management

### View in Drizzle Studio:
```bash
npm run db:studio
```

### Direct SQL Access:
```bash
psql "postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_jBsFth8Dck0w@ep-empty-bush-ae60wjbm-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

## Development Notes

- CORS is set to accept all origins in development (`origin: true`)
- Ports automatically adjust if defaults (3001/5173) are in use
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env`
- Database connection uses Neon's serverless driver

## Ready to Build! ðŸš€

Your judging system is now ready for development. You can:
- Create more organizations with custom application forms
- Build rubrics with different scoring types
- Add applicants and submit applications
- Evaluate applications using your rubrics
- Map fields between organizations

Happy coding!
